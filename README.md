# 🚀 Code Capital (Working Title)

**Code Capital** is a fully UI-driven software development simulation game built with Flutter.

Start with a small company and a single employee. Take contracts, grow your team, build software products, compete against AI-driven rival companies, and navigate a dynamic tech market driven by trends, saturation, and random global events.

Your goal? Build a tech empire without going bankrupt.

## 🧠 Systems & Simulation

- Tick-based simulation engine
- Dynamic market economy
- AI competitor decision-making
- Bankruptcy & IP auction system
- Procedural tech news generation
- Skill-based productivity system
- Team size & complexity-based development scaling

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The game follows Clean Architecture principles.

### Key Design Principles

- Simulation logic separated from UI
- Event-driven architecture using BLoC
- Pure Dart simulation engine
- Offline-first design

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Flutter**
- **BLoC** for state management
- **Isar** for local database
- **Freezed** & `json_serializable` for immutable models
- Tick-based game loop
- Fully offline gameplay (Cloud save planned)

---

## 📊 Market Simulation

The in-game economy dynamically adjusts based on:

- Software saturation
- Global trends
- Random events
- AI company releases
- Player actions

AI companies can:

- Compete in trending markets
- Release rival products
- Go bankrupt
- Auction off intellectual property (IP)
- Be replaced by new indie startups

---

## 🎯 Vision

Code Capital aims to create a deep yet accessible tech industry simulator focused on strategy, systems, and decision-making rather than graphics.

Inspired by management simulations like Game Dev Tycoon and the terminal-driven interface style of Hacknet, the game emphasizes economic strategy, competition, and long-term planning.
